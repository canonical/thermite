# thermite

**thermite is beta software.  Please use it with caution and report any bugs you discover.**

thermite is a Ubuntu Linux command-line tool that automates packaging the upstream Rust
toolchain into versioned Ubuntu `.deb` source packages.  It implements the two primary
workflows used by Ubuntu Foundations toolchain maintainers:

- **`update`** — create a new versioned `rustc-X.Y` source package for a new upstream
  Rust release (e.g. `rustc-1.85`).
- **`backport`** — adapt an existing versioned `rustc-X.Y` package for an older Ubuntu
  Long-Term Support (LTS) release.

Reference workflows:
- Update (official docs): <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/project/maintainers/niche-package-maintenance/rustc/update-rust/>
- Backport (official docs): <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/project/maintainers/niche-package-maintenance/rustc/backport-rust/>
- Backport (runbook): `docs/rust-backporting-runbook.md` — an AI-generated, Design-by-Contract formalisation of the official backport docs; subordinate to them and kept in sync.

---

## Overview

Every new upstream Rust release requires a new versioned source package (e.g. `rustc-1.85`)
to be created in the Ubuntu archive.  The process involves many ordered steps: fetching the
upstream source with `uscan`, refreshing Debian patches with `quilt`, pruning unwanted
vendored dependencies, updating control files, running local builds with `sbuild`, checking
the result with `lintian`, uploading to a PPA, running `autopkgtest`s, and finally requesting
sponsorship.

thermite drives the entire sequence, fully automating what can be automated and pausing at
checkpoints that require human judgment (patch conflicts, copyright stanza authoring, build
failure triage, etc.).

---

## Prerequisites

The following tools must be installed and available on `PATH` before running thermite.
On Ubuntu, most are available through the standard package repositories or as snaps.

| Tool | Ubuntu package / snap | Purpose |

| `git` | `git` | Version control |
| `dch` | `devscripts` | Debian changelog editing |
| `uscan` | `devscripts` | Upstream source download |
| `gbp` | `git-buildpackage` | Import upstream source into Git |
| `quilt` | `quilt` | Patch management |
| `dpkg-buildpackage` | `dpkg-dev` | Source package building |
| `sbuild` | `sbuild` | Clean-room binary package builds |
| `lintian` | `lintian` | Debian policy compliance checks |
| `cargo` | `rustup` snap | Rust build tool (for vendor pruning) |
| `rustup` | `rustup` snap | Rust toolchain manager |
| `dput` | `dput` | Upload packages to Launchpad PPAs |

### `thermite update`

Creates a new versioned `rustc-X.Y` Ubuntu source package for a new upstream Rust release.

```
thermite update [OPTIONS]
  -u, --rust-update-version <X.Y.Z>   Rust version being packaged  (e.g. 1.85.1)
  -o, --rust-old-version    <X.Y.Z>   Rust version being replaced  (e.g. 1.84.0)
  -r, --release             <NAME>    Target Ubuntu release         (e.g. noble)
  -l, --lpuser              <NAME>    Launchpad username
  -b, --lp-bug-number       <NUMBER>  Launchpad bug ID for this work
  -g, --git-remote          <NAME>    Local remote for Foundations rustc repo
                                      [default: foundations]
  -d, --repo-dir            <PATH>    Debian source package root
                                      [default: current directory]
```

#### Example: update Rust from 1.84.0 to 1.85.1 for Noble

```sh
cd ~/rustc/rustc          # the cloned Foundations rustc Git repository
thermite update \
  --rust-update-version 1.85.1 \
  --rust-old-version    1.84.0 \
  --release             noble \
  --lpuser              jdoe \
  --lp-bug-number       2109761
```

#### Example: same update with verbose command output

```sh
thermite -v update \
  --rust-update-version 1.85.1 \
  --rust-old-version    1.84.0 \
  --release             noble \
  --lpuser              jdoe \
  --lp-bug-number       2109761
```

The `-v` flag prints every external command (prefixed with `+`) before it is
executed, which is useful for understanding exactly what thermite is doing or for
diagnosing failures.

#### Example: update with per-phase explanations

```sh
thermite -vv update \
  --rust-update-version 1.85.1 \
  --rust-old-version    1.84.0 \
  --release             noble \
  --lpuser              jdoe \
  --lp-bug-number       2109761
```

The `-vv` flag enables everything `-v` does and additionally shows a concise
explanation with a link to the official documentation at the start of every phase.
This is particularly useful for maintainers who are new to the Rust toolchain
packaging workflow.

### `thermite backport`

Adapts an existing versioned `rustc-X.Y` package for an older Ubuntu release.

```
thermite backport [OPTIONS]
  -u, --rust-version      <X.Y.Z>   Rust version to backport        (e.g. 1.85.0)
  -s, --source-release    <NAME>    Ubuntu release to port FROM      (e.g. noble, or 'devel')
  -r, --release           <NAME>    Ubuntu release to port TO        (e.g. jammy)
  -l, --lpuser            <NAME>    Launchpad username
  -b, --lp-bug-number     <NUMBER>  Launchpad bug ID (optional; omit for proactive backports)
  -g, --git-remote        <NAME>    Local remote for Foundations rustc repo
                                    [default: foundations]
  -d, --repo-dir          <PATH>    Debian source package root
                                    [default: current directory]
```

#### Example: backport Rust 1.85.0 from Noble to Jammy (with bug)

```sh
cd ~/rustc/rustc
thermite backport \
  --rust-version    1.85.0 \
  --source-release  noble \
  --release         jammy \
  --lpuser          jdoe \
  --lp-bug-number   2100492
```

#### Example: proactive backport (no bug number)

```sh
thermite backport \
  --rust-version    1.85.0 \
  --source-release  noble \
  --release         jammy \
  --lpuser          jdoe
```

#### Example: backport with per-phase explanations (recommended for first-time use)

```sh
thermite -vv backport \
  --rust-version    1.85.0 \
  --source-release  noble \
  --release         jammy \
  --lpuser          jdoe
```

Pass `-vv` to display a concise explanation of what each phase does and why,
together with a link to the relevant section of the official docs.
Pass `-v` (single) to print each external command without the explanations.

### `thermite tarball`

Standalone management of the two source tarballs outside the full update/backport
workflows. Each tarball can either be **downloaded** (staging PPA first, then the
Ubuntu primary archive via `rmadison`, with a manual-placement fallback) or
**generated** (`uscan` for the orig tarball; `rustup` + `cargo-vendor-filterer` +
`debian/rules vendor-tarball` for the vendor tarball). An already-obtained
tarball can also be **overlaid** into the repo directory.

```
thermite tarball download orig|vendor|all [OPTIONS]
thermite tarball generate orig|vendor|all [OPTIONS]
thermite tarball overlay   orig|vendor|all [OPTIONS]

  -u, --rust-version   <X.Y.Z>  Full Rust version the tarballs are named after
  --series             <NAME>   Ubuntu release adjective for backport-style names
                                (e.g. noble → '+dfsg~26.04'). Omit for plain
                                update naming ('+dfsg')
  -d, --repo-dir       <PATH>   Debian source package root
                                [default: current directory]

generate only:
  --force                       Overwrite a tarball that already exists in the
                                parent directory (without it, generate refuses)

vendor and all only (overlay):
  --replace                     Remove the existing vendor/ directory before
                                extracting (clean replace instead of merge)
```

Downloads are idempotent: an existing tarball is reused. Generation overwrites
only with `--force`. The vendor tarball generation requires `rustup` and produces
`../rustc-<X.Y>_<X.Y.Z>+dfsg[~<series>].orig-vendor.tar.xz`. Neither download
nor generate touches the working tree — run `thermite tarball overlay`
afterwards to extract a tarball into the repo dir.

Overlay never fetches or produces tarballs: the expected tarball must already
exist in the parent directory (use download/generate first), otherwise the
command refuses. Overlaying the orig tarball extracts its full contents into
the repo dir with the top-level `rustc-<X.Y.Z>-src/` directory stripped;
overlaying the vendor tarball merges `vendor/` into the repo dir, or cleanly
replaces it with `--replace`. With `all`, the orig tarball is overlaid first
and `--replace` applies to the vendor part only.

#### Example: regenerate the orig tarball for a backport

```sh
cd ~/rustc/rustc
thermite tarball generate orig \
  --rust-version 1.85.0 \
  --series       noble
# produces ../rustc-1.85_1.85.0+dfsg~26.04.orig.tar.xz
```

#### Example: regenerate the vendor tarball and overlay it (clean replace)

```sh
thermite tarball generate vendor \
  --rust-version 1.85.0 \
  --series       noble \
  --force
thermite tarball overlay vendor \
  --rust-version 1.85.0 \
  --series       noble \
  --replace
```

#### Example: download both tarballs for a plain update naming scheme

```sh
thermite tarball download all --rust-version 1.85.1
```

#### Example: restore the working tree from existing tarballs after a git clean

```sh
cd ~/rustc/rustc
thermite tarball overlay all \
  --rust-version 1.85.0 \
  --series       noble
```

## rmadison result cache

`thermite backport` and `thermite tarball download` query the Ubuntu archive
with `rmadison` — once per compatibility-check dependency (LLVM, libgit2,
dh-cargo, pkgconf, cmake, debhelper) and once per tarball download. These
answers change rarely: a package that was once absent from a release's archive
(e.g. a new LLVM in an older LTS) will essentially never appear there, and a
cached version string stays valid until that package's next archive update.
Re-querying on every run adds network latency without adding information, so
thermite caches the raw `rmadison -u ubuntu <query>` output.

- **Location** — `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/canonical/thermite/rmadison/` (defaulting to
  `~/.cache/canonical/thermite/rmadison/`), one plain-text file per query.
- **Scope** — keyed by query only, so one cached `libgit2` result serves every
  target release.
- **Hits** — when a cached result is used, thermite prints its age (from the
  file's modification time), e.g. `rmadison: using cached result for libgit2 (3d old)`.
- **Misses** — only successful queries are cached; failures (network errors,
  missing `rmadison`) are never stored.
- **Correctness** — the cache is best-effort. Unreadable, corrupt, or missing
  entries simply trigger a fresh query; cache errors never fail a workflow.

The `--cache` flag controls this behaviour (works on every subcommand):

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `on` (default) | Use cached results when present; fetch, store, and return on a miss |
| `off` | Ignore the cache entirely — always fetch, never read or write entries |
| `update` | Always fetch fresh results and overwrite cached entries |
| `clear` | Wipe the cached rmadison results, then behave like `on` |

```sh
# Repeat a backport reusing earlier rmadison answers (default):
thermite backport --rust-version 1.85.0 --source-release noble --release jammy --lpuser jdoe

# Archive contents changed since the cache was populated (e.g. a package just
# entered the target release): refetch and refresh the cached entries:
thermite --cache update backport \
  --rust-version 1.85.0 --source-release noble --release jammy --lpuser jdoe

# Diagnose a suspicious result without touching the cache:
thermite --cache off backport \
  --rust-version 1.85.0 --source-release noble --release jammy --lpuser jdoe

# One-off invalidation of every cached rmadison result:
thermite --cache clear backport \
  --rust-version 1.85.0 --source-release noble --release jammy --lpuser jdoe
```

## AI Disclosure

> **Important:** This project was planned, generated, and iteratively refined with the
> assistance of Large Language Model (LLM) tools, specifically GitHub Copilot (powered by
> Claude Sonnet).

LLM assistance was used throughout the development of thermite, including:

- **Planning** — the implementation plans in `/plans/` were drafted with LLM assistance
  based on the official Ubuntu Rust packaging docs.
- **Code generation** — the majority of the Rust source code was generated or substantially
  revised through LLM-assisted sessions in VS Code.
- **Bug fixing** — several correctness issues (error handling, version substitution in
  `debian/watch`, rate-limit retry logic, etc.) were identified and resolved through
  LLM-assisted review.
- **Documentation** — this README and inline doc comments were written with LLM assistance.

All generated code and documentation has been reviewed by human maintainers, but users
should be aware that LLM-generated code can contain subtle errors.  Before running
thermite against a real Ubuntu package repository, review the workflow phases carefully
and verify that the tool's actions match the official docs linked above.

If you find a bug or an incorrect workflow step, please open an issue.
