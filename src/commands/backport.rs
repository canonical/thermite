            (pre-building the bootstrapping chain for future use). Priority backports \

            authoritative source lives on 'merge-X.Y' instead, and thermite \
            probes the Foundations remote to pick the right branch automatically. \
            Backports must go one release at a time (e.g. Noble→Jammy, never \
            Questing→Jammy directly) to isolate release-specific failures and \
            provide stable checkpoints. The branch is not pushed to the \

            (e.g. '~22.04.1'). This ensures the backport version sorts strictly lower than \

            (4) pkgconf availability, (5) cmake version, (6) debhelper-compat level. \
            Each check infers the required version from the source packaging, queries \
            the archive via rmadison, and reports whether action is needed. Fixes are \
            applied before the orig tarball is generated so that vendored sources \

            'Files-Excluded' in debian/copyright. If LLVM or libgit2 vendoring is needed \
            (see the compatibility checks in Phase 4), 'Files-Excluded' must be edited first \
            and the tarball regenerated before running this phase. The tarball is renamed to include \

            — this test is resource-intensive and routinely times out on the autopkgtest \

            are expected for versioned rustc packages (e.g. 'field-too-long \

            on native architectures). PPA Ubuntu-dependencies must be set to 'Security' \
            (not 'Proposed') because backports target the security pocket. If the bootstrap \
